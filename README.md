## About Kitto

Kitto is mac productivity app that helps you stay focused while working, without constantly switching between different apps.

Here's a screenshot:

It’s still in beta, but here’s what it currently does:

**Core features:**

Snap widgets that give you a quick glance at stock tickers, your calendar, timezones, and Gmail — all in one screen

Terminal ↔ File Browser integration: Open either side in the same location, jump between them easily

Quick preview: Instantly peek into files in the browser without opening another app; this works for pdfs, jpegs, csvs, quite a bit of other extension file types.

Smart positioning: It remembers where you left off — folders, tabs, layout — so you're not reorienting every time you return

Built-in Juptyer Lab widget: defaults to dark theme but can be toggled.

Dashboard state: once you save the dashboard state, it will prompt if you want to set as default. It saves positions and you can save as many dashboards as you want.

**Latest features:**

Each terminal maintains its own history. I'd consider enhanced features like "most common commands or (cd-ed) paths".

Stocks and time zones can be updated in the UI, and saves in the Dashboard state.

The goal is to reduce tool-hopping and help people stay in flow — whether you're coding, organizing files, or just checking something quickly.
